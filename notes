HTML has a head and a body
<em>: emphasize <i>: italics
By default, the visual result is the same. However, the semantic meaning is different. 
The <em> element represents stress emphasis of its contents, while the <i> element represents text 
An example for <em> could be: "Just do it already!", or: "We had to do something about it". A person or software reading the text would pronounce the words in italics with an emphasis, using verbal stress.
An example for <i> could be: "The Queen Mary sailed last night". Here, there is no added emphasis or importance on the word "Queen Mary". It is merely indicated that the object in question is not a queen named Mary, but a ship named Queen Mary.
Table also have a head and a body
